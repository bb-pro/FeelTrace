                info: "\n\n  What is the difference between sports and fitness? You will learn more in this article.\n\n  Many of us are engaged in physical activity. Someone to lose weight, someone to gain muscle mass, and someone was simply taught to do exercises in the morning.\n\n  A large number of people are ready to call any physical exercise a sport, considering that this is a generalizing concept for all loads. However, these are completely different concepts.\n\n  Not all exercises can be called sports. And accordingly, not every person can be called an athlete. What people do in gyms in clubs is called fitness.\n\n  Let's figure out what is the difference between sports and fitness.\n\n  Goals\n\n  The most important difference is the different goals set by athletes and those who practice fitness. The main tasks of fitness are to get a toned body, strengthen health, burn fat, increase muscle mass and strength, develop endurance and flexibility. Anyone can go to the gym, repeat exercises from the Internet or television, or just go for a jog and on the horizontal bars. To achieve the desired result, you do not need to make exorbitant efforts. You can start doing fitness at any age, if there are no health contraindications.\n\n  And when it comes to sports, the main task is sports achievements, records, winning competitions at various levels, obtaining a rank. Athletes, as a rule, have been engaged since childhood, expose their bodies to enormous physical exertion and always aim at one thing — achieving maximum results, they strive to win and give their best to the limit of their capabilities.\n\n  Risks\n\n  In big-time sports, a person invests in every exercise to the maximum and goes beyond their capabilities, therefore, the probability of serious injury is very high. Diseases of the cardiovascular system are also common among athletes, because it is constantly subjected to huge loads. In fitness, with a smart approach to training and without fanaticism, the likelihood of injury can be minimized.\n\n  Skill development\n\n  With the right approach and regular training, fitness gives you the opportunity to do just a little bit at once: put your figure in order, develop body flexibility, make your muscles prominent, develop strength and endurance.\n\n  In sports, physical qualities and skills do not develop all together. Each sport has its own specifics. For professional runners and cyclists, the main quality is endurance, for wrestlers — strength, for gymnasts — flexibility and coordination of movements. In some of these qualities, an athlete develops, reaches heights, sets records, wins, and in something else he may be absolutely 'not pumped up'.\n\n  Food\n\n  There are also differences in the nutrition of athletes and people who are engaged in fitness. The former have a strict diet that helps them achieve their goals. For example, those who need to develop strength consume large amounts of protein. In fitness, everything is simpler and it's enough just to have a balanced diet and not lean on junk food.\n\n  Daily schedule\n\n  In professional sports, training takes up most of the time and the daily routine is scheduled minute by minute for months ahead. Special schedules are drawn up for athletes — cycles, according to which they, for example, prepare for the Olympics or other competitions. Any deviation is fraught with not achieving the desired results. In fitness, everything is simpler, a person comes to training in his free time and whenever he wishes. And if he wants to take a break, he won't be able to take any problems from it.\n\n  So, now you and I know that fitness is a more gentle exercise that is aimed at maintaining and strengthening health. For fitness, it is enough to engage in feasible physical activity at any convenient time and eat right. And sport is a professional activity that is associated with a focus on: achieving athletic results, winning competitions, setting records; these are exorbitant loads for the body, the risk of injury, a strict diet and daily routine. Fitness is like a part of life. And sport for a person becomes his whole life."

                info: "Improve your metabolism\n\n In addition to many other functions, metabolism regulates the amount of energy a person spends. If it increases, the body consumes more calories. As a result, it is easier to lose weight. To have a good metabolism, you need to regularly expose your body to a gentle load. It is also worth drinking more water and eating fruits that stimulate metabolism, namely: avocado; grapefruit; cayenne pepper; cinnamon; dill; coconut oil; green tea; garlic.\n\n Eat nutritious foods\n\n Pay special attention to this item if you have a good appetite and you are constantly suffering from hunger. Start eating nutritious foods and you will be able to reduce your portions. To do this, include foods containing a lot of fiber in your menu, for example: fruit muesli; vegetable pates; legumes (soy, vetch, beans); nuts (not fried or salted); chia or flax seeds; whole grains.\n\n Drink enough water\n\n If you start eating more fiber, it is also recommended to increase your water intake. Thanks to this, you can not only feel full, but also help your body digest fiber. Very often people just think they are hungry. And when they drink a glass of water, they realize that it was just thirst.\n\n Take care of the removal of fluid from the body\n\n Many people suffer from fluid retention. Because of this, they gain both extra weight and extra volumes. To remove the liquid, a different approach is needed than with fats. To do this, you need to improve the diuretic functions of the body with the help of such products: pineapple; watermelon; garlic; cucumber; lettuce; pear; asparagus; nettle; dandelion; onion.\n\n Eat high-quality protein\n\n You should also take care to eat a lot of protein. And that's because it also improves metabolism. As a result, fat is more easily converted into muscle. This means that it helps to make the waist slimmer. Protein is found not only in meat. It must be combined with other animal and vegetable proteins, for example: eggs; fermented dairy products; fish, legumes; dried nuts and sunflower seeds.\n\n Less carbs\n\n Today we eat a lot of carbohydrates, which do not bring any benefit. These include bread, desserts, and pizza. It is necessary to reduce the consumption of such carbohydrates by replacing them with more nutritious ones, for example: brown rice; oatmeal; millet; quinoa; buckwheat flour; potatoes; jerusalem artichoke; pumpkin; bananas.\n\n Chew your food well\n\n Careful chewing of food helps to improve digestion, promotes the absorption of nutrients. Thanks to this, you are more likely to overeat and get up from the table earlier. This good habit is extremely important. This is especially true for people who eat too fast due to lack of time or a constant state of anxiety. It is also better to eat away from the workplace and where you do not feel stressed and nervous. You need to isolate yourself from what distracts you."

                info: "Vegetable oils: what are they useful for, what vitamins and trace elements are they rich in\n\n The variety of vegetable oils is great, and they all have their own unique beneficial properties. The most common and important oils for the human body are flaxseed, pumpkin, rapeseed, sesame and olive. Any oil is a source of healthy fats, which are necessary for every person. In addition, each of the products has a storehouse of vitamins and trace elements.\n\n Flaxseed oil contains omega — 3, 6 and 9. It is also rich in linoleic, linolenic, oleic and stearic acids, which support the normal functioning of the body. On the shelves, you can often see linseed oils of different types: for weight loss, for athletes, etc. In fact, this is the same oil, but in this way the manufacturer attracts the attention of buyers of different target groups. It should be noted that the seller does not cheat, and this oil is a really good helper both in fat burning and for maintaining the body during intense workouts.\n\n Rapeseed oil ranks second in the world in terms of frequency of consumption after sunflower oil. It is rich in vitamins E, A, B, D, and also contains calcium, magnesium and phosphorus. A very important property of this oil is that it helps the female body prepare for conception, because it contains a plant analogue of the hormone estradiol.\n\n Pumpkin oil is an indispensable product for the normalization of the gastrointestinal tract and biliary system, it is rich in vitamins A, E, F, C, P and B vitamins. This oil strengthens the immune system, improves metabolism, promotes the restoration and growth of the body's bone tissues.\n\n Sesame oil is suitable for those who want to strengthen the cardiovascular system. Sesame oil has a beneficial effect on the central nervous system, as it contains a large number of essential amino acids, phospholipids and antioxidants, as well as vitamins and trace elements.\n\n Olive oil is very well absorbed by the human body in comparison with other oils. Its high content of vitamin E improves the health of the skin, hair and nails, and also has a rejuvenating effect.\n\n Sunflower oil is the most popular oil in the world and has a high digestibility. Regular use of this oil strengthens the immune system, has a beneficial effect on vision due to the content of beta-carnitine in it. Vitamin K improves the condition of the circulatory system, and the tocopherol contained in the oil normalizes metabolism and prevents the development of tumors."

                info: "Rest\n\nRest – sports training should be stopped after injury. In the period from 24 to 72 hours (depending on the severity of the damage), complete immobilization is required for the use of the remaining components of the RIPL.\n\n  Immobilization is the creation of immobility or a decrease in the mobility of body parts in case of damage.\n\n  Immobilization is necessary at the initial stage of damage treatment, in order to ensure rest, the use of ice, pressure bandages and giving an elevated position.\n\n  It must be remembered that after the end of the initial period, rest should be relative, since complete immobilization worsens the athlete's health due to the occurrence of muscular atrophy, joint stiffness and decreased cardiovascular endurance.\n\n  On the contrary, early mobilization accelerates healing processes, stimulates the growth and reunification of damaged tissues, prevents the formation of adhesions in joint capsules and helps maintain coordination and sports-related skills, trains the cardiovascular system, accelerates a safe return to sports.\n\n  ICE\n\n  Ice – cooling the injury site reduces signs of inflammation (swelling, pain, redness). Ice treatment is called cryotherapy. The most effective use of ice is in the first 10-15 minutes from the moment of damage. How to use ice: the damaged area is covered with a wet towel, and ice is applied to it. The towel must necessarily be wet, as a dry towel will insulate the skin from cooling. When using ice, there will be a cold, burning sensation, followed by pain and numbness.\n\n  A cooling method called 'ice massage' is very effective (Mikeli Lyle, 1997). To do this, water is frozen in a plastic disposable cup, then the upper edge of the cup is torn off, while the bottom of the cup remains as an insulating gasket, allowing the athlete to massage the damaged area with slow circular movements. This type of massage combines two elements of RIPL – the use of ice and pressure. Ice should be applied as often as possible in the first 72 hours. In case of minor injuries, it is sufficient to apply ice for the first 24 hours. Ice is applied to the injury site for a period of 10 to 30 minutes at a time, the intervals between applications are 30-45 minutes.\n\n  Pressure\n\n  Pressure is compression of the injury site, the pressure should be constant and moderate. It is necessary to reduce swelling at the site of injury. Compression of the injury site can be carried out both during cooling and outside of cooling. During cooling, you can apply pressure by applying an ice massage, or apply a pressure bandage to an ice pack and an injured limb. During the period when cooling is not carried out, you can use an elastic bandage for a pressure bandage. An elastic bandage is applied 2-3 cm below the injury site and bandaged up in a spiral, overlapping coils, starting with a uniform greater compression, and then more freely. It is necessary to periodically check the skin color, temperature and sensitivity at the site of injury so as not to pinch a nerve or artery.\n\n  Lift\n\n  Lifting is necessary to prevent the accumulation of fluid formed during inflammation. To do this, it is necessary to keep the damage site in an elevated position from 24 to 72 hours. For example, an athlete with a lower limb injury should lie down using a pillow to lift the injured limb."

                info: "\n\n We all work out to keep our bodies healthy and fit. The pros of exercise on health are exceptional. It can protect you from several heart diseases, diabetes, etc. But only the right kind of exercise will provide such benefits and it is important to know that the workout and it’s way changes as we grow older. We cannot do the same exercises at 40 that we were able to do in our 20s or 30s, due to the shifting metabolism that decreases 2-3 percent with age. Our energy and the strength of our muscles change. We feel pain in areas where we never thought that we would, but with the right kind of work out you can still be in shape, even in your 70s. You are never too old to workout.

Weight lifting in this age is crucial, especially for women. Start with lifting lighter weights and then move to heavier ones. Do cardio 3-4 times a week because not only it will help you lose the extra weight but will also improve your mood and sleep.\n\n Above 40’s\n\n In your 50s, 60s and so on, your muscle tone decreases rapidly. So you cannot do workouts as you like. You should first consult your doctor/physician. Common exercises for seniors include cycling, walking, swimming, etc.\n\n Stretching and Flexibility\n\n As we age, the muscles of our body get tighter which can increase the risk of injuries. That is why stretching and building flexibility in your body is important, if you want to stay active. Dynamic stretches and warm-ups include slow controlled movements which helps in enhancing flexibility.\n\n Avoid weight machines\n\n As you go in your 40s and 50s and above, you should avoid weight machines because it can cause damage to your muscles. Instead of using them, do squats or lunges which will help you train your muscles more effectively\n\n Resistance Trainin\n\n We start losing 2-3 percent of our muscle mass with every decade, it is essential to do resistance training because the mass is replaced by fat. So it will help in burning it and strengthening the muscles.\n\n Yoga\n\n We lose our balance as we age. Yoga helps maintain or regain balance and improves joint mobility. If you want to stay fit even when you grow older, then you should follow the above-mentioned suggestions."

                info: "\n\n This is you must warm-up before a workout\n\n Here are some exercises that will help you warm up before a workout:\n\n Push-ups\n\n Push-ups are the ultimate exercise to target all your upper body muscle groups. There are different variants of push-ups, and you can alternate between variants. Do a comfortable number of reps for push-ups, and you can’t do them in a single rep, possibly even divide the push-ups into three sets\n\n Push-ups are easy to do, and they don’t require dumbbells or rods, so you can do them without having the risk of hurting yourself much\n\n But do be careful, perform push-ups slow and steady, or you might end up injuring your shoulder or arm.\n\n Pull-Ups\n\n Pull-Ups are an excellent exercise that targets your back. Pull-Ups are also used to build strength and will help your upper body pump a lot of blood that is needed for a proper pre-workout\n\n If you think pull-ups are too difficult, you can always do chin-ups. Chin-ups are easier to do, and you can always use support from a friendly bro\n\n If you are unable to reach the pull-up rod, you can also do pull-ups on the pull-up machine or use a seat to reach up there.\n\n Supine Knee Cross\n\n If you are working on your whole body, you need to warm up for your lower body too. The Supine Knee Cross is one of those exercises. Supine Knee Cross is a warm-up exercise that helps loosen your lower back, so you can easily do your lower body exercises without having to worry about injuring your lower body\n\n The Supine Knee Cross might seem like a pretty difficult exercise, but it is not. It helps you stretch your lower body, ultimately loosening up the lower body muscles that might be sore.\n\n Running\n\n Running slowly for 5-7 minutes is a good way to warm up for a full-body workout. Running is one of those exercises that target all the body, and you can run at your own pace, if you are running for at least 5 minutes\n\n Running also helps build up stamina and improves body-mind coordination in the long run.\n\n Hip Opener\n\n As the exercise name suggests, the hip opener is a nice exercise that helps open your hips so they can be used without any chance of injury. Hip opener is very easy to do and doesn’t take much time at all.\n\n Side Shoulder Raise\n\n Your shoulders are at the most risk of getting injured in many exercises that you do. Personally, my shoulders used to get injured on a heavy bench press. Side shoulder raise is a safe exercise that specifically targets your shoulders and can even be used as a workout exercise\n\n You should use a light-weight dumb-bell for this raise.\n\n Conclusion\n\n These are the exercises that you should do pre-workout, so you don’t end up injuring yourself after workouts."
